* ERC-20 Token Contract with Enhanced Minting and Burning
  
* Comprehensive Overview

This robust Solidity smart contract seamlessly integrates the ERC-20 token standard with advanced minting and burning capabilities, catering to single-owner management. It empowers the owner to mint new tokens and grants token holders the autonomy to burn their own holdings.

* Key Features
  
ERC-20 Standard Adherence: Upholds the ERC-20 standard, ensuring fungible token functionality and compatibility within the Ethereum ecosystem.

Minting Authority: Empowers the contract owner to mint new tokens, expanding the token supply to meet evolving demands.

Burning Mechanism: Grants token holders the ability to burn their tokens, reducing the overall supply and potentially enhancing the value of remaining tokens.

Transfer: Leverages the standard ERC-20 transfer function, eliminating the need for custom implementation and ensuring seamless integration with existing ERC-20 infrastructure.

* Deployment and Interaction

Effortlessly deploy the contract using Remix or your preferred Ethereum development environment. Once deployed, interact with the contract's functionalities through the provided functions.

* Detailed Function Descriptions
  
mint(address _to, uint256 _value): Exclusively accessible to the contract owner, this function mints new tokens and transfers them to the specified address. The _value parameter dictates the number of tokens to be minted.

burn(uint256 _value): This function enables any token holder to burn a specified quantity of their tokens, effectively reducing the total token supply. The _value parameter indicates the number of tokens to be burned.

transfer(address _to, uint256 _value): This function overrides the ERC-20 standard's transfer function, introducing custom behavior while maintaining core ERC-20 functionalities. It allows token holders to transfer tokens to other addresses seamlessly.
